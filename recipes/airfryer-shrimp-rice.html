    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This fried rice is so deliciously savory, nobody will believe you made it with an air fryer. It's full of toasted, crunchy rice bits that add a great contrast to the chewy interior. The shrimp is tender and juicy, and the bites of peas burst in your mouth. Finish it up with Sriracha mayo and fresh green onion to compliment everything perfectly. If you don't have shrimp on hand, you can also use leftover chicken or steak.
